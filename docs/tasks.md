# Announcer Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive, logically ordered checklist of improvement tasks for the Announcer project. Each task is marked with a checkbox [ ] that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

[x] Implement a proper error handling strategy throughout the application
[ ] Refactor the ATEM state change handling to use a more maintainable pattern (e.g., strategy pattern)
[ ] Implement dependency injection for better testability and flexibility
[ ] Create a proper logging system instead of using console.log
[ ] Separate configuration loading from business logic for better separation of concerns
[ ] Create a proper application lifecycle management system

## Code Quality Improvements

[ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all function parameters and return values
[ ] Implement the TODOs in atem.ts:
   [ ] Support for multiple M/Es (Mix Effects)
   [ ] Support for multiple keyers
   [ ] Improve handling of repeated preview taps
[ ] Add proper error handling for OpenAI API calls
[ ] Add validation for environment variables with meaningful error messages
[ ] Refactor the audio.ts module to handle errors when playing sounds
[ ] Replace non-null assertions (!) with proper null checks
[ ] Implement a more robust file naming strategy for cached speech files

## Testing Improvements

[ ] Add unit tests for core functionality:
   [ ] atem.ts
   [ ] audio.ts
   [ ] openai.ts
   [ ] env.ts
[ ] Implement integration tests for the complete workflow
[ ] Add test coverage reporting
[ ] Implement mock for OpenAI API for testing
[ ] Implement mock for ATEM connection for testing
[ ] Add tests for error handling scenarios
[ ] Create a test environment configuration

## Documentation Improvements

[ ] Document the environment variables with examples
[ ] Create diagrams explaining the application architecture
[ ] Add a troubleshooting guide
[ ] Document the caching mechanism

## DevOps Improvements

[ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline (github actions)
[ ] Implement automated testing in CI
[ ] Add code quality checks (linting, formatting) to CI
[ ] Create a proper release process (a single published npm module that can be ran as a standalone CLI daemon)
[ ] Implement semantic versioning
[ ] Add Docker support for easier deployment (ATEM simulator running inside docker)
[ ] Create deployment documentation for different environments (including Raspberry Pi)

## Performance Improvements

[ ] Optimize the text-to-speech caching mechanism
[ ] Implement batch processing for precomputing speeches
[ ] Add performance monitoring
[ ] Optimize memory usage for long-running instances
[ ] Implement connection retry mechanism with exponential backoff
[ ] Optimize audio playback for low-resource environments

## Security Improvements

[ ] Add input validation for all external inputs
[ ] Create a security policy document

## User Experience Improvements

[ ] Add configurable voice options for announcements
[ ] Add support for multiple languages
